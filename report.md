## Project

Name: Apache Samza

URL: https://github.com/apache/samza

Apache Samza is a distributed stream processing framework. It is a scalable data processing engine that allows
 you to process and analyze your data in real-time. 
    
## Architectural overview (optional, as one item for P+)

## Selected issue(s)

Title: Refactor TaskContextImpl to not include access to objects that are only used internally

URL: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA-1935

TaskContext should be a public API but TaskContextImpl is being used to pass around objects for internal use. Some 
internal components cast TaskContext to a TaskContextImpl to access these objects, which is not ideal.

## Onboarding experience

The onboarding documentation is actually very good in this project and can be found in the README.md. We did not have to search for information on a different place to be able to build the project and run tests using gradle.
Gradle was a required tool to build the project. The project specified commands for building the project using gradle as well as where to download gradle if you donâ€™t have it on your local machine.

Samza integrates with YARN for dependency management and running stream-processing as a managed service. Samza works with YARN to distribute resources and it also handles failures of individual instances and automatically restarts them. And scala is a programming language that combines an object oriented approach and functional programming into one high level programming language.

The build as well as the tests conclude without any errors.


## Requirements affected by functionality being refactored

We need to split up the internal functionality by creating a separate object which is only passed around internally 
and is decoupled from TaskContextImpl.

## Existing test cases relating to refactored code
